This is firebrand, a library and sample CLI utility for reading and
writing to (E)EPROMs using Willem's EPROM programmer.

It currently runs under GNU/Linux, although it is hoped to contain the system-specific
details to a single file, pin_utils.c.  A generic API (pin_utils.h) should allow the
software to be ported to other Unix-like OSes.

 ** NB. Don't leave the chip in the device!  Place it in once the CLI says.     **
 **     There is an unfortunate bug in the kernel that means the chip *might*   **
 **     be partially erased if left in the holder.  I haven't tested if this    **
 **     is really a problem.                                                    ** 

For details of the EEPROM programmer hardware, see:

For licensing, see the file COPYING.LIB.  The file COMPILING contains information on
how to compile the code.

Try:
  ./firebrand --help
for hints on how to use the CLI.  Its pretty straight forward.


Enjoy!
